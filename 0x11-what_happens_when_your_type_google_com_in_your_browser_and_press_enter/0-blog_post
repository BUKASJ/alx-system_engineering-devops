Here's a breakdown of what happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter:


1. DNS Request:

Your browser doesn't understand domain names like "google.com." It needs an IP address to connect to the server.
The browser initiates a DNS (Domain Name System) request. This request acts like a phonebook lookup.
The request goes to a local DNS resolver (often provided by your internet service provider) or a public DNS server.
The DNS server checks its records and retrieves the IP address associated with "google.com."


2. TCP/IP:

Once the browser has the IP address (e.g., 142.250.184.196), it can initiate communication with the Google server using the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite.
TCP establishes a reliable connection between your computer and the server, ensuring data arrives in the correct order and without errors.
IP handles the actual routing of data packets over the internet.


3. Firewall (Optional):

Your computer or network might have a firewall in place.
The firewall acts as a security barrier, checking if the incoming connection (from Google) is allowed.
If the firewall allows the connection based on its rules, it proceeds.


4. HTTPS/SSL:

Since the URL starts with "https," the browser initiates a secure connection using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).
HTTPS uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt communication between your browser and the server. This protects data from eavesdropping or tampering.
The browser establishes a secure connection by performing a handshake with the server, verifying the server's identity using its SSL certificate.


5. Load Balancer (Optional):

Large websites like Google often use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers.
The load balancer acts as a traffic director, ensuring requests are routed to an available server to handle the load efficiently.


6. Web Server:

The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the web server (identified by the IP address).
The request specifies the resource you're trying to access (in this case, the homepage "/" of "google.com").
The web server receives the request and processes it.


7. Application Server (Optional):

The web server might delegate tasks to application servers.
Application servers handle dynamic content generation, interacting with databases or other services to create the web page.
In Google's case, application servers likely generate the dynamic content you see on the homepage.


8. Database (Optional):

Depending on the requested resource, the application server might need to retrieve data from a database.
The database stores information relevant to the website, like user accounts, search results, or product details.
The application server queries the database, retrieves the data, and uses it to build the web page.


9. Response:

The web server (or application server) prepares a response containing the HTML code for the Google homepage, along with other resources like images and stylesheets.
The response is sent back to your browser over the secure HTTPS connection.


10. Rendering:

Your browser receives the response and interprets the HTML code.
It fetches additional resources like images and stylesheets based on the instructions in the HTML.
The browser renders the web page on your screen, displaying the Google homepage.
